# Jan A. Krzywda Research Organization

Welcome to the research organization of Jan A. Krzywda, focused on advancing quantum technologies through machine learning, control systems, and innovative quantum applications.

## Research Areas

### üß† [Quantum Learning Machines](quantum-learning-machines/)
**Practical use of noisy quantum devices for data-driven learning, reinforcement learning and generative AI.**

Exploring the intersection of quantum computing and artificial intelligence, developing practical applications for noisy quantum devices in machine learning contexts.

### ‚ö° [Charge Noise in Spin Qubits](charge-noise-spin-qubits/)
**Arguably the biggest obstacle to large scale spin qubit device. Experimental characterization and ab-initio simulation.**

Addressing one of the most critical challenges in quantum computing through comprehensive experimental analysis and theoretical modeling of charge noise effects.

### üéÆ [Quantum Games](quantum-games/)
**Games drive progress, from chess to computer graphics. Now the time has come to quantum technologies.**

Developing quantum game theory and interactive quantum applications that drive innovation in quantum computing technologies.

### üî¨ [Spin Qubits Emulator](spin-qubit-emulator/)
**Spin qubit are complex. Lots of data is needed for autonomous tuning and new algorithms dev. Digital twin is needed for that.**

Creating sophisticated digital twins of spin qubit systems to enable autonomous tuning, algorithm development, and comprehensive data analysis.

### üéõÔ∏è [Quantum Feedback Control](quantum-feedback-control/)
**Qubits suffer from dynamical noise. We deploy real-life FPGA controller to track down and correct random fluctuations.**

Implementing real-time quantum control systems using FPGA technology to mitigate dynamical noise and stabilize quantum states.

### ü§ñ [Machine Learning for Quantum](machine-learning-quantum/)
**Classical machine learning methods for processing and simulating quantum systems and devices from sparse data.**

Applying classical machine learning techniques to understand, simulate, and optimize quantum systems using limited experimental data.

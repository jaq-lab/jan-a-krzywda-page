# Jan A. Krzywda Research Organization

Welcome to the research organization of Jan A. Krzywda, focused on advancing quantum technologies through machine learning, control systems, and innovative quantum applications.

## Research Areas

### üß† [Quantum Learning Machines](https://github.com/JAK-lab/quantum-learning-machines)
**Practical use of noisy quantum devices for data-driven learning, reinforcement learning and generative AI.**

### ‚ö° [Charge Noise in Spin Qubits](https://github.com/JAK-lab/charge-noise-spin-qubits)
**Arguably the biggest obstacle to large scale spin qubit device. Experimental characterization and ab-initio simulation.**

### üéÆ [Quantum Games](https://github.com/JAK-lab/quantum-games)
**Games drive progress, from chess to computer graphics. Now the time has come to quantum technologies.**

### üî¨ [Spin Qubits Emulator](https://github.com/JAK-lab/spin-qubit-emulator)
**Spin qubit are complex. Lots of data is needed for autonomous tuning and new algorithms dev. Digital twin is needed for that.**

### üéõÔ∏è [Quantum Feedback Control](https://github.com/JAK-lab/quantum-feedback-control)
**Qubits suffer from dynamical noise. We deploy real-life FPGA controller to track down and correct random fluctuations.**

### ü§ñ [Machine Learning for Quantum](https://github.com/JAK-lab/machine-learning-quantum)
**Classical machine learning methods for processing and simulating quantum systems and devices from sparse data.**

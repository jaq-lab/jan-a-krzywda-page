I personally believe spin qubits are one of the most promising platforms for large scale quantum computing. For sure they are on top, in terms of interesting physical phenomena to analyze. Besides that we are often promising to leverage highly repeatable industrial technologies to create devices containing milions of qubit, but at current stage getting tens fully functional qubits is a challenge.

Spin qubits live inside an electricially defined potential well. Naturally, the main challenge is the electrostatic disorder, which causes fluctuations of qubit parameters in time and between the qubits. While even small fluctuations degrate the performance of quantum algorithms, large fluctuations can make qubits useless at all, which takes place if our control knobs are not able to bring the qubit to the operational point. There are two most important control knobs, the plunger gate which digs deeper well and barrier gate which controls the hills between the wells.
